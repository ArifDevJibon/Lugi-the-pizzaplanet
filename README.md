# Lugi-the-pizzaplanet
A responsive restaurant website i made with SASS and Bootstrap. Which is my first project with SASS.
You can see visit the site on "https://devarifhossain02.netlify.com". [Don't mind the loading time coz of the fee host and large image files]

NOTE: Though all the codes were writtern by me from scratch, the images and some design petern was inspired by a wordpress site i found olnine.
